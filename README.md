# RacingMonkeys

## Overview

After the Inchworm robot, here's another fun and educational project: RacingMonkeys. This project involves creating two 3D-printed racing monkeys controlled by ESP32 and a mobile app developed with MIT App Inventor. Despite design challenges, it was a hit with my kid, who loved racing her pink monkey against my brown monkey.


## Build Process

Follow the step-by-step guide to build your RacingMonkeys:

1. **3D Print Parts**: Design in TinkerCad and print the components.
2. **Assemble Electronics**: Use ESP32, battery, and motor to create the circuit.
3. **Develop App**: Create a control app using MIT App Inventor.
4. **Final Assembly**: Combine all parts and test the monkeys.
